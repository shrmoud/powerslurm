  <h2>Week 1 - Oct 3</h2>
  <p>In the first three weeks, I was to prepare myself for the material. In the first week, I read the following research papers:
  <a href="TPDS.pdf">Utilization, Predictability, Workloads, and User Runtime Estimates in Scheduling the IBM SP2 with Backfilling</a>,
  <a href="ClusterScheduling.pdf">Job Scheduling in HPC Clusters</a>
   and <a href="Sean.pdf">A Data Driven Scheduling Approach for Power Management on HPC Systems</a>.  
   
All three of the papers pertain to methods of optimizing cluster systems between real life frameworks.
I went over these papers several times, taking detailed notes to make sure I understand as much as I can from these. 
For now, I have no quesitons about these concepts; I am sure some will pop up with practice. However, for now I trust
the authors to know what they are talking about. I also met with professor Zhiling Lan and discussed my plans and actions for the next three weeks.</p>
  

  
  <h2>Week 2 - Oct 10</h2>
  <p>As the first week came to a close, I made sure that I understood the three cluster/scheduler concepts.  there is already the master list 
  which contains all of the jobs in the wait queue.  The window is just a selection of the top N jobs from that queue.  
  When we do scheduling, we do it on the window list, not the queue on the whole.  We are concerned about the algorithm,0-1 Knapsack, 
  but we only apply that algorithm to the window as it would most surely cause jobs 
  to starve if it worked on the entire queue. I also tried out the <a href="HPC/AzureSLURM.html"> Microsoft Azure SLURM Example.</a><br>
</p>


<h2>Week 3 - Oct 17</h2>
  <p>SLURM implements <code> default_queue_depth=# </code> which specifies the number of jobs to consider for scheduling on 
  each event that may result in a job being scheduled. 
  Default value is 100 jobs. Since this happens frequently, a relatively small number is generally best.
  Thi could be used as our window in our window based scheduling approach.
  
  I also found the Google Groups for the different SLURM groups.
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyslurm">PySLURM Group</a> and 
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/slurm-devel">SLURM Developer Group</a>
  I also tried installing the <a href="http://www.bsc.es/marenostrum-support-services/services/slurm-simulator">SLURM Simulator</a>
  </p>

<h2>Week 4 - Oct 24</h2>
  <p> PowerSLURM would implement the use case where the scheduler will implement power aware scheduling wherein there is max system utilization 
  while staying under power cap.
  Using <a href="http://www.gingergeeks.co.uk/pyslurm/index.html">PySLURM</a> for 
  implementing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#0.2F1_knapsack_problem">Knapsack Problem</a> 
  </p>

<h2>Week 5 - Oct 31</h2>
  <p> Running the <a href="https://byuhpc.github.io/BYUJobScriptGenerator">Job Script Generator</a> on
  the SLURM Simulator and collecting Data.
