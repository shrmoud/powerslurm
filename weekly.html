  <h2>Week 1 - Oct 3</h2>
  <p>In the first three weeks, I was to prepare myself for the material. In the first week, I read the following research papers:
  <a href="TPDS.pdf">Utilization, Predictability, Workloads, and User Runtime Estimates in Scheduling the IBM SP2 with Backfilling</a>, <a href="ClusterScheduling.pdf">Job Scheduling in HPC Clusters</a>
   and <a href="Sean.pdf">A Data Driven Scheduling Approach for Power Management on HPC Systems</a>.  
   
All three of the papers pertain to methods of optimizing cluster systems between real life frameworks.
I went over these papers several times, taking detailed notes to make sure I understand as much as I can from these. For now, I have no quesitons about these concepts; I am sure some will pop up with practice. However, for now I trust
the authors to know what they are talking about. I also met with professor Zhiling Lan and discussed my plans and actions for the next three weeks.</p>
  

  
  <h2>Week 2 - Oct 10</h2>
  <p>As the first week came to a close, I made sure that I understood the three cluster/scheduler concepts. I also tried out the <a href="HPC/AzureSLURM.html"> Microsoft Azure SLURM Example.</a><br>
</p>


<h2>Week 3 - Oct 17</h2>
  <p> Found the 
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyslurm">PySLURM Group</a> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/slurm-devel">SLURM Developer Group</a>
